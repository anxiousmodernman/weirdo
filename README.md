Just trying to draw a damn triangle.


## lspci

Use `lspci` to get output on connected devices.

## vulkan-utils

On Ubuntu, get vulkan-utils to test if your system is ready for Vulkan.

```
sudo apt-get install vulkan-utils
```

Run this command for some verbose hardware info.

```
vulkaninfo
```

On Arch? _TODO_
